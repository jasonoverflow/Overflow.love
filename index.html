“I’ve never loved anyone the way I loved him. And maybe it’s because he didn’t have to say it. He sang it. Not in some big performance, not in a show-off way—just in this small moment where he opened a door, and I stepped in, and my voice cracked, and it still didn’t matter. He already liked me. I just couldn’t see it then.”<!-- index.html -->
